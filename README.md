# QSM
Spatial modulation (SM) is a recently proposed wireless transmission technique that uses multiple antennas. The basic idea of this modulation scheme is to map a set of information bits into a modulated symbol (PSK or QAM) and a second set of information bits in selecting the transmit antenna numbers. The advantage is increased bandwidth efficiency without increasing the complexity of the receiver as compared to conventional MIMO systems. The code is used to evaluate the performance of this modulation scheme and assess the effects of correlation between the wireless channels of the transmit antennas on its performance.
